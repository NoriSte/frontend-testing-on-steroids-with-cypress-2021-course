Main E2E test defects

# Stability

If you run the test multiple times you can encounter some failures like this

or like this, if you're running Cypress through the terminal

In detail, the Cypress Test Runner says

<div>
    <img src="../assets/images/e2e-test-defects-stability/test-stability-feedback.png" alt="Test stability feedback" style="width: 100%; max-width: 576px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-border"/>
</div>

it means that the "_No articles are here_" string does not exist in the page, but why? The first screenshot shows that the signup process worked, why did the test fail?

Do you remember that [Cypress waits automatically](cypress-waitings-and-execution-order.md#automatic-waiting)? Well, it's true, but it does not wait forever, `cy.get` and `cy.contains` wait up to 4 seconds (by default) but if the AJAX call lasts more than 4 seconds we are out of luck.

The fastest (but not the robust) solution is to increase the `cy.contains` timeout with the following change

```diff
-cy.contains("No articles are here").should("be.visible");
+cy.contains("No articles are here", { timeout: 10000 }).should("be.visible");
```

Now the test is going to succeed most of the times.

The complete test is the following:

<i>File: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-2.e2e.spec.js</i>
[include](../cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-2.e2e.spec.js)

Anyway: this test started smelling a while ago, go ahead to read why should we improve it.

Please note: you must completely avoid fixed-time waitings (`cy.wait(10000)` with Cypress) because you make the tests extremely slow! Read more about that [here](https://dev.to/noriste/await-do-not-make-your-e2e-tests-sleep-4g1o).
