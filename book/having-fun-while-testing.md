# Having fun while testing

- testing allows you to learn, in two ways:

  - when you start building an application with a new framework or library, you cannot be sure that what you do today does not break what you did yesterday. If you test your code while you write it, you could avoid this situation
  - when you do not understand how a library works: you are going to understand it as soon as you're able to test it

- once you start automating everything, you cannot stop

- testing throw responsibility away (in good meaning) because you are no more an elephant in a glass shop. Instead, while touching some code, you are part of a protected-by-tests sandbox, working becomes easier
