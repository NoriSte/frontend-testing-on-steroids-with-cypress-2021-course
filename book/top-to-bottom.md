# An easier journey: top to bottom

When you are an experienced tester, approaching a test suite is a nice road. But learning how to test properly, what to test and what to avoid, which kind of tests to choose etc. is not an easy journey.

More: **testing is expensive at the beginning**. Everything is new, the examples you try to implement do not work, debugging a test could be hard...

We think that **approaching a test suite from the bottom to the top does not help**. Starting with some unit tests is easy because they're a pretty simple topic, but does not help you with deadlines, nor having a good confidence about your app.

It's harder to manage some functional/end-to-end tests but you have more fun and, above all, you have full confidence about your app. Even if you end up having a single end-to-end (E2E from now on), this single test is more useful than having hundreds of unit tests.

Starting with the E2E tests does not only give you more confidence (and **satisfaction**, it's important too) but it let you understand in a while the limitations of the most confident, yet expensive, kind of tests.

That's why we teach this course following the opposite flow: from the top (E2E tests) to the bottom (unit tests).

Please note: **every kind of test is important**, but they serve a different purpose. At the beginning, choosing between them is hard, that's why we start exploring the tests that you can not miss(due to the best return of investment): the E2E tests.
