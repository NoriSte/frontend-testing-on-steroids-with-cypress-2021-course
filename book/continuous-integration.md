# Continuous integration

Cypress has a [dedicated CI page](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html) on its site with configurations [for the different providers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Examples). Cypress can be run with its UI (`npx cypress open`) or in headless mode (`npx cypress run`), the only thing you need to do is to launch the front-end server and then, when the server is up and running, launch Cypress in headless mode.

The most used package is [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) that allows you to do exactly what its name says. You can see it in action even in the [repository of this book](https://github.com/NoriSte/javascript-testing-practical-approach-2021-course/blob/master/package.json), take a look at the `test` script, it's something like

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "start-server-and-test realworld:start http://localhost:4100 cy:run"
}
```

you can read the script as: run the `realworld:start` script and, when the `http://localhost:4100` endpoint becomes available, launch the `cy:run` script.

Cypress has its own [Dashboard product](https://www.cypress.io/dashboard/) that allows easy navigation between all the test runs, the single tests, the results. It allows to parallelize the test runs and to host the test videos.
